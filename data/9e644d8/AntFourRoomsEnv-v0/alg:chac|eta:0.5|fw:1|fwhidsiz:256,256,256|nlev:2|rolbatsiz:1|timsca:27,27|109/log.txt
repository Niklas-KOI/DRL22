*** Warning ***
You are running baselines.chac with just a single MPI worker. This will work, but the HER experiments that we report in Plappert et al. (2018, https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09464) were obtained with --num_cpu 19. This makes a significant difference and if you are looking to reproduce those results, be aware of this. Please also refer to https://github.com/openai/baselines/issues/314 for further details.
